One of the benefits of being on Propel is that the programme features access to a vast array of ‘perks’.

One of these perks is [$1,000 in credit towards Notion’s Team Plan](https://www.notion.so/startups), which I’m delighted to have just received.

A number of my final year students have been using Notion and I’ve been meaning to put it through its paces. Now I have no excuse.

Notion – if you’re unfamiliar with it – bills itself as, “one tool for your wiki, notes, projects and more.” Their case study – featuring [Cocoon](https://www.ourcocoon.com/) – summarises the tools’ capabilities a little more snappily, billing it as, “Your startup’s operating system.”

Given my mission – to put world-class education within reach of all – I’ve been experimenting with using Notion to create a wiki that collects everything I’ve ever taught.

I think there’s something in the idea of sharing two decades of my teaching materials for free, but selling ‘learning pathways’ through that content. Put simply: the content would be accessible to all, always, but I’d sell support to take learners through it.

I’m still toying with this idea – especially after my meeting with Atto on Friday – but I think there might be something in it.
