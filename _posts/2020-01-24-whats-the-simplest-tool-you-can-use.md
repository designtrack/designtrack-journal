Ask yourself: What’s the simplest tool you can use? **Use that and don’t overcomplicate things.** This is one of the most important lessons I’ve learned during my first fortnight on [Propel](https://igniteni.com). 

This message has been hammered home over and over, in particular, during my office hours sessions with the mentors. **Ship, test, iterate (repeat).** 

As a designer, I’m used to: sketching a page; developing wireframes and userflows; creating high-fidelity mockups; building a prototype; and, finally, coding everything up in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. (Or, more accurately, working with a third party on the code part of the equation.)

This is a time-consuming process – **too time-consuming** – and it doesn’t help me to test my thinking or my assumptions.

As I start to develop designtrack, **focusing on customers and pricing models**, I’m embracing off-the-shelf tools that I can use to build ‘just good enough’ prototypes so I can test my thinking quickly. This is saving me time and leading to better data to inform my thinking.

It’s incredible, there are a multitude of tools **with very shallow learning curves**, that you can use to **publish content and test it on your audience**. The following tools – which are either free to use or have free, unpaid tiers – have been lifesavers for me.

* [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com)
* [Landen](https://www.landen.co)
* [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com)
* …

I built the following (unfinished) [landing page](https://gi0iuwfan21u.landen.co) using Landen during Monday’s landing pages workshop. It’s good enough to trial my messaging and, at this stage, **good enough is all that matters**.

Being on Propel is encouraging me to rethink my processes, which has taught me a great deal. When you’re **at the beginning of your startup journey** it’s important to **shift your focus from ‘finished’ to ‘fast’**. Fast is what matters.
