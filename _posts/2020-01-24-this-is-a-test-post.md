Lo-Fi designtrack Journal
-------------------------

**Task 1: Top Priority**

I need this as soon as humanly possible, so I can share updates and gather signups. This is going to look like my [old site][01].

You could pull [some of the CSS from there][02], or – probably better – start from scratch. **Right now, however, all I care about is getting the raw, no CSS, content up there as time is of the essence.**

I’ll be designing it [a la Jonnie Hallman’s site][03] and Frank Chimero’s (which mentions Jonnie’s). I like Frank’s [Table of Contents][04] so that might be worth considering. Maybe with a Previous Post, Next Post link at the bottom.


### !important

This will look totally different to designtrack.org as it’s a [designtrack × Propel][05] journal about my time on the Propel programme.
