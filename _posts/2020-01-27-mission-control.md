I'm getting used to finding my way around the system. It's lovely, but like any new system, it takes a little getting used to.

A handful of things to ask Tim…

1. On the '[What’s the simplest tool you can use?](/2020/01/24/whats-the-simplest-tool-you-can-use.html)' page, there are YAML fields for: layout, title and date. But, on this page there's no layout.
2. Can we link up the \[designtrack\] under the post.
