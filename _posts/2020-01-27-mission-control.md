Forestry is lovely, but like any new system, it takes a little getting used to. I'm getting used to finding my way around and writing as I do.

You're right, I'm using the raw editor, it fits me perfectly like a finely tailored suit.

A handful of things I need to ask…

1. On the '[What’s the simplest tool you can use?](/2020/01/24/whats-the-simplest-tool-you-can-use.html)' page, there are YAML fields for: `layout`, `title` and `date`. But, on this page ('Familiarisation') there's no field for `layout`. Why is that?
2. Can we link up the \[designtrack\] under the posts?
3. Can we (maybe?) link the Unix timestamp (minus an link underline) to somewhere that explains what a timestamp is. This might be a post on this site.

I think that's it for now.
