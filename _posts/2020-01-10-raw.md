This is the first post…

Propel kicks off on Monday, 13 January and I'm getting everything ready.

I'll be keeping a journal here so I can capture everything I learn on the programme. On #ixdbelfast we encourage our students to maintain a research diary, where they reflect upon what we cover.

It's only fitting that I do the same.

More shortly. Like fsck… this journal will start with raw content. I'll be styling as I go and sharing the process.
