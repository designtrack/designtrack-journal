![The Simplest Tool](/uploads/simplest-tool.png)


This is the first postâ€¦ /*  I need to copy and paste all the posts over from my Simplenote file. */

Propel kicks off on Monday, 13 January and I'm getting everything ready to start on the journey.

I'll be keeping a journal here so I can capture everything I learn on the programme. On #ixdbelfast I encourage my students to maintain a research diary, where they reflect upon what we cover.

It's only fitting that I do the same.

Like [fsck](https://fsck.mrmurphy.com) this journal will start with raw content. I'll be styling as I go and sharing the process. (Similar to the [journal](https://dev.mrmurphy.com/redesign/) for Mr Murphy, which is embarassingly in need of love and attention!)

Anyhow, watch this space. I'll share everything. The highs and the lows.
