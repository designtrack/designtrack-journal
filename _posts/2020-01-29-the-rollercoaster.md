This morning, I woke to an inbox full of emails. There was one, in particular, I was looking for.

Scrolling through the list, I found it.

> We would like to thank you for your time and effort in submitting the Concept Grant Application Form and for presenting to Techstart in January 2019.
> 
> Unfortunately, we regret to inform you that your application has not been successful.

At that moment, I was – as you’d expect – hit with a wave of disappointment. I’d put a great deal of effort into articulating my vision for designtrack.

This application for £10,000 of support was intimately integrated into my spreadsheet, perhaps a little too intimately.

The problem – as I later discovered during the feedback – was that the problem I had articulated, whilst interesting, hadn’t been innovative enough to qualify for support.

The feedback Techstart provided was fantastic, identifying weaknesses I needed to address if I were to be successful.

The startup journey is – like the Kickstarter journey – a rollercoaster of intense highs (being accepted onto Propel) followed immediately by intense lows (being unsuccessful).

I’ll share more of the lessons I learned in a future post, but the lesson I learned is that I needed to build an emotional bomshelter (as my Masters graduate and Get Invited co-founder, Kyle Gawley, once told me).

Lesson learned.
