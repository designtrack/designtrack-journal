**Do you want to learn user interface (UI) design?** If so, I’m working on something that might interest you.

After much thought, I’ve decided to start small – **very small!** – with [designtrack](https://designtrack.org). I’m going to focus on **building the best possible learning experience** and I’m going to keep the number of learners **super, super limited**.

Over the last few weeks, as I’ve undertaken market research, **I’ve learned that there are, so far, two important types of customer**:

+ UX designers – freelance and employed – who are **in need of a creative (and technical) refresher**; and
+ developers who would like to **learn the fundamentals of UI design**.

To get the ball rolling, I’m going to focus on the latter group.

I currently have three passionate individuals who have signed up for **an alpha version of ‘Building Beautiful UIs’**, a four week FastTrack course, **focusing on the fundamentals of user interface design**.

This course will use the published (and soon-to-be-published) materials from my **[‘Building Beautiful UIs’](https://bbuis.org)** course in a book for Adobe.

Based on the model of teaching I use at Belfast School of Art, I’ve built a course around the content in the book, to give everyone focus. We’ll work together on the design of a small travel app, which will allow us to focus on:

+ principles of layout;
+ the important of clear information architecture;
+ typography; and
+ colour.

There are 6–8 places available in total, so **there are just ~5 places left**. If you’d like to be notified when tickets are on sale, so you don’t miss out, [drop me a line](mailto:christopher@mrmurphy.com?subject=Let%20me%20know%20when%20designtrack%20launches…&amp;body=Tell%20me%20more%20about%20the%20UI%20course…), and I’ll talk you through the plan.

Our FastTrack courses are normally priced at £450 per person, but **for this alpha I’ll be heavily discounting the price to £300**.

In addition to the four week core programme, I’ll work with the 6–8 participants to help them one-to-one. In the spirit of building a community of learners, I’ll be learning as much from the participants as they learn from me.

**Think this is an exciting opportunity to join a small learning community and supercharge your skillset.**
