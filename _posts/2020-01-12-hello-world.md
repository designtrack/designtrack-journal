![Hello, World!](/uploads/001-hello-world.png)

It’s been a time-honoured tradition of mine to launch any new journal with a short [‘Hello, World!’][01] post. In that post, I set out my intentions and outline what I hope to achieve through this particular body of writing.

I’m also known for embracing [a raw, minimally styled approach][02] when I’m focused primarily on content. The primary benefit of this approach is a focus on content first, design second ([if, indeed, I focus on design at all][03]).

I’m excited to be starting my journey into 2020 as one of 5% of applicants who were accepted onto Ignite’s [Propel][04] pre-accelerator programme, to develop my new startup, [designtrack][05].

I’ll be maintaining a journal here, noting lessons I’ve learned on the programme, so I can return to them later. (I have a dreadful memory.)

This journal is largely a personal affair, but others may find some value in it. If that’s you, I’m glad you find the content useful. Feel free to [get in touch][06], I'd love to hear from you.

Starting a startup is like getting a ticket for a rollercoaster ride: you have days where you feel that nothing the world can throw at you will shake your beliefs; but you also have days where you find yourself questioning everything.

I’ll be honest: I’ll share the highs and the lows of my startup journey. Through honesty, I hope to document what it’s like to embark on a new venture, one where you are simultaneously filled with determination and doubt.

If you’re following along, I hope you enjoy the journey.

—Christopher, [@fehler][06]
