As I noted in my first post, I have a tradition of starting a new site with minimal styling. I was delighted when Chris McClelland – one of Propel’s mentors – highlighted Jonnie Hallman’s [Destroy Today][01] raw redesign.

Hallman is a friend of mine (and an incredibly talented one, at that). Many years ago, I collected him from the airport in Belfast, when he arrived for the final instalment of [Build][02]. (I have fond memories of that time.)

I don’t know how I missed his redesign in the open, but needless to say, I was delighted when I saw it. As Hallman put it, in his opening post:

> Rather than fall into the trap of writing serious, heavily-edited, long-form blog posts, I’ll try my best to keep these short, frequent, and to-the-point.

His aim is to spend no more than a quarter of an hour per post. I suspect – given that I’m documenting my journey on Propel – that timeframe might be a little tight for me, but I will endeavour to post frequently and keep my posts focused.

As Hallman concludes his opening article: “I already feel like I’ve written too much. Keep an eye on this space, and keep me active if I start to slack.”

I’d urge you to do the same: If I forget to post, [feel free to give me the nudge I need][03].

—Christopher, [@fehler][03]
